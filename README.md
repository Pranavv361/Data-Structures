# Data Structures

## Description
This C++ project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) using an array-based approach. It includes classes for ArrayBTNode, which represents each node in the binary tree, and ArrayBST, which represents the binary search tree itself. The project allows insertion of elements into the BST, searching for elements, displaying the tree in pre-order and in-order traversal, and printing the raw data of the tree.
Also Graph Database and sorting algorithms (Bubble and Shell Sort)
## File Structure
- `arrayDataStructureUsingStack & Vector.cpp`: Main file containing the implementation of the Array Binary Search Tree.
- `dataframeClass.cpp`: Other C++ file for implementing a dataframe class.
- `generalizedDataStructure.cpp`: Other C++ file for implementing generalized data structures.
- `graphDatabase.cpp`: Other C++ file for implementing a graph database.
- `graphDatabaseExtension.cpp`: Other C++ file for extending the graph database implementation.
- `sortingAlgorithms - Shell and Bubble.cpp`: Other C++ file for implementing sorting algorithms (Shell and Bubble sort).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pranavv361/Graph-Database`
2. Compile the main C++ file: `g++ arrayDataStructureUsingStack\ \&\ Vector.cpp -o arrayBST`
3. Execute the compiled program: `./arrayBST`

## Features
- Insert elements into the BST.
- Search for elements in the BST.
- Display the BST in pre-order and in-order traversal.
- Print the raw data of the BST.
- Handles overflow conditions when the tree is full.
- Sorting elements - Bubble and Shell Sort
- Graph Database

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
